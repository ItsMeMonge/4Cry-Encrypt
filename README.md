#### 📋 Use Cases for DESTROY Command

**When to use `destroy`:**

1. **Sensitive Data Elimination**: When you need to permanently remove files containing:
   - Personal information (SSN, credit cards, passwords)
   - Confidential business data
   - Classified documents
   - Financial records
   - Private communications

2. **Before Device Disposal**: Securely wipe data before:
   - Selling computers/laptops
   - Donating hardware
   - Corporate asset disposal
   - Recycling devices

3. **Compliance Requirements**: Meet security standards for:
   - GDPR (data right to erasure)
   - HIPAA (health information)
   - PCI-DSS (payment data)
   - Sarbanes-Oxley (financial records)

**Best Practices:**

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS confirm before destroying
# The command requires typing "DESTROY" to proceed

# 2. Use strong passwords for maximum security
node 4cry.js destroy sensitive_data/ -p "ComplexPassword123!@#" --overwrite-passes 25

# 3. Test first on non-critical data
node 4cry.js destroy test_folder/ -p "test" --overwrite-passes 10

# 4. Use more passes for highly sensitive data
node 4cry.js destroy ultra_classified/ -p "password" --overwrite-passes 30

# 5. Generate password automatically for one-time use
node 4cry.js destroy temporary_files/ -g --overwrite-passes 20

# 6. Destroy large folders efficiently
node 4cry.js destroy massive_folder/ -p "secure" --overwrite-passes 15
```

**⚠️ Important Warnings:**

- ❌ **IRREVERSIBLE**: Once destroyed, data CANNOT be recovered
- ❌ **NO BACKUP**: Unlike `erase`, this creates NO backup file
- ⚠️ **PASSWORD**: Keep password safe during destruction process
- ✅ **VERIFY**: Check that folder/file doesn't exist after completion
- ✅ **BACKUP**: Always backup critical data before using `destroy`

**Recommended Overwrite Passes:**

| Data Sensitivity | Recommended Passes | Use Case |

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 🔒 Important Security Requirements

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use passwords with at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
2. **Password Backup**: Store passwords securely - without them, files are unrecoverable
3. **Sensitive Files**: For extremely sensitive data, consider using the automatic password generator
4. **Integrity Verification**: The system automatically detects corrupted or modified files
5. **Metadata Privacy**: Use `--hide-metadata` flag for enhanced privacy when encrypting sensitive files
6. **Size Camouflage**: Use `--camouflage-size` to hide the real file size (e.g., `--camouflage-size 5MB`)
7. **Random Camouflage**: Use `--random-camouflage` for automatic random size generation
8. **Key Management**: Use the secure key storage system for password management

### 🛡️ Best Practices

- **Always use strong passwords** for sensitive operations
- **Store passwords securely** using the built-in key management system
- **Enable privacy features** for maximum privacy protection
- **Verify file integrity** after encryption/decryption operations
- **Use unique passwords** for each encryption operation
- **Regular security audits** of stored keys and encrypted data
- **Secure backup procedures** for critical encrypted data

## 🚧 Current Limitations

- **File Size Limits**: Maximum 2GB per file (configurable limit)
- **Memory Requirements**: Large files require sufficient RAM for processing
- **Password Dependency**: Decryption requires exact password (no recovery mechanism)
- **Key Storage**: Master key must be protected (no key recovery if lost)
- **Processing Time**: Advanced security operations take longer due to multiple layers
- **Storage Overhead**: Security features add ~20-30% to file size
- **No Backdoors**: System has no recovery mechanisms or backdoors

## ❓ FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### 🤔 Why didn't my PDFs work in v2.1?
Version 2.1 had aggressive preprocessing that modified binary data. v2.2 removes this completely.

### 📊 Why did compression decrease?
We prioritized **integrity** over extreme compression. It's better to have 20% safe reduction than 70% with corruption risk.

### 🔐 Are files still secure?
**Yes!** AES-256-GCM security remains unchanged. We only simplified compression.

### 🚀 What's the difference from the original "For Cry"?
- **Original**: Funny name, ultra-compression 
- **v2.2**: Funny name, **actual functionality** 😭

### 📄 Can I use it with any file type?
**Yes!** PDFs, images, videos, executables - all work perfectly in v2.2.

### 🔒 What does the --hide-metadata option do?
The `--hide-metadata` flag removes file metadata from the encrypted file, providing enhanced privacy for sensitive documents. This prevents information about the original file from being stored in the encrypted container.

### 🎭 What does the --camouflage-size option do?
The `--camouflage-size` flag allows you to hide the real size of your encrypted file by adding random padding. This is useful for operational security when you want to disguise that a small file contains important data. For example, a 1KB text file can be made to appear as a 10MB file.

**Examples:**
- `--camouflage-size 5MB` - Makes the file appear as 5 megabytes
- `--camouflage-size 1.2GB` - Makes the file appear as 1.2 gigabytes  
- `--camouflage-size 500KB` - Makes the file appear as 500 kilobytes

**Important:** The camouflage size must be larger than the original encrypted file size.

### 🎲 What does the --random-camouflage option do?
The `--random-camouflage` flag automatically generates a random size for your encrypted file based on intelligent algorithms. This provides maximum security without requiring you to specify exact sizes.

**How it works:**
- **Small files (< 1KB)**: Multiplied by 10-100x (e.g., 100 bytes → 1-10 KB)
- **Medium files (< 1MB)**: Multiplied by 5-50x (e.g., 50 KB → 250 KB - 2.5 MB)
- **Large files (< 100MB)**: Multiplied by 2-10x (e.g., 10 MB → 20-100 MB)
- **Very large files (≥ 100MB)**: Multiplied by 1.1-3x (e.g., 200 MB → 220-600 MB)

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic**: No need to calculate sizes manually
- **Intelligent**: Adapts to file size for realistic camouflage
- **Secure**: Random generation prevents pattern analysis
- **Convenient**: Perfect for batch operations
